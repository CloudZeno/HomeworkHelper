# HomeworkHelper

Small project I made in my free time. Scrapes the web for links relevant to your question. Suggest free sources other than brainly.

1. Enter your question
2. Enter how many times you want to search (generally 1 is perfect. Only increase the number if no results are found.)
3. Press submit


Helpful Tips:
1. Links with a star are more relevant
2. If it can't find a source even with 5 searches, it probably wont ever find a source
